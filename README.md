#Photon

Photon is a toy-programming language made in Python. The reason I chose Python to do it is because of it's simpicity and it's ability
of getting things done quickly. I just wanted to try and make a new language without having to do all the important stuff you would
need to do in a language like C. With Python, I could just jump right in making the lexer, parser and code generator.
