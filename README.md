# Photon

Photon is a toy-programming language made in Python. The reason I chose Python to do it is because of it's simpicity and it's ability
of getting things done quickly. I just wanted to try and make a new language without having to do all the important stuff you would
need to do in a language like C. With Python, I could just jump right in making the lexer, parser and code generator. As a plus, since
Python is an interpreted language itself, the compiler does not need to be "ported" to different platforms, all you need is to download
the corresponding Python interpreter for your machine.
